        It was a blast hosting Hackpack (our crash course on the basics of hosting a hackathon) with
        the new organizers. They were all so attentive and had lots of valuable insights. It was a
        good idea incorporating discussion questions in this presentation because there's some ideas
        they brought out that we'll definitely incorporate in our hackathon (we won't say what just
        yet, it's a teaser for now!)
      </p>
      <p>
        After we gave an overview of the different aspects of planning a hackathon, we asked the new
        organizers what they would want to focus on, and I'd say their roles fit their qualities
        really well. The coding whizzes (Eddy and Xavier) are revamping the website (I'm excited to
        see them have fun and impress us with what they do), Miaoying's design will help with
        advertising, and Sunny's organization will definitely be a strength in our budgeting. One
        thing I found the most exciting was that all the new organizers were willing to explore out
        of their comfort zones and learn how to contact sponsors. Outreach is a great skill to have,
        and we'll do our best to show them the ropes!
      </p>

        The senior organizers were just as sharp too --- Though it wasn't mandatory for them to help
        out with Hackpack, they diligently came. Bryan helped with planning the presentation and
        aiding the discussion, Avery provided valuable insights, and Allen helped us provide the
        IslandHacks resources for the organizers.

        We're on the tail end of getting the logistics and scaffolding ready, and I'm excited for
        the following weeks --- we're gonna have a great time organizing IslandHacks again!

        We had a get-to-know-each-other meeting between the senior organizers and the newcomers and
        went over the goals of this upcoming hackathon. I'd say it went pretty well. Everyone's
        excited, super friendly as always, and the newcomers weren't afraid to ask any questions
        they had at the moment. It's definitely a good idea to do a crash course with them soon to
        get them on board as soon as possible. I'm looking forward to it!

        Nael and I looked over the feedback form from IslandHacks 2023 and jotted down a list of
        what we should focus on for the next one. We're gonna expand this for sure, but I wouldn't
        reveal everything we planned just yet. :] (Actually I'll give you one. This blog is an
        addition to keep you guys updated.)

        Although it took us six months to plan the original hackathon, I believe we can still host a
        hackathon by the end of May. Most of that time in the beginning was figuring out what we're
        doing and getting off the ground. We now have the resources from last year to bounce off of
        and new organizers to recruit, but that doesn't mean we should slow down. Let the grind
        begin!
