        <p>IslandHacks is a hackathon - social coding event - organized and led by high school students in Alameda. The goal of the event is to provide students with a fun opportunity to explore their interests in STEM through collaborative and innovative project creation.</p>
        <!-- This should be more call to action-ish (~Register now!~). Also maybe add a section (in this tag or else where) with included parts of the event other than coding, like prizes, food, raffle, photo booth, career things etc. -->
